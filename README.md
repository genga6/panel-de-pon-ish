# Panel de Pon-ish

Just a thing I made for fun.  
Built with React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS â€” mostly to mess around and try stuff out.

It's kinda like *Panel de Pon* on the Super Famicom.  
Swap blocks, match 3, they disappear.  
The board slowly rises. If it hits the top, game over.

Original game (by Nintendo):
